							<h2>Hi!<br /></h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a 5th year PhD candidate in the Departement of Physics and Astronomy at UCLA. My research centers on the use of strong gravitational lensing by galaxies as a probe of the nature and origins of dark matter. <br /><br />
						I've included a link to where you can watch a couple animations I made of strong gravitational lensing, which in my opinion is one of the most spectacular and in-your-face examples of mind-bending weirdness of our universe. Some of the content there was made with the software pyHalo, a python package I wrote to quickly generate realizations of dark matter halos in lens galaxies and along the line of sight, and lens them. If you're interested in using this software for your lensing projects, feel free to contact me.</p>

          <h1>Strong Gravitational Lensing</h1>
            
            <h3>What is strong lensing</h3>
						<section>
							<p> Imagine looking through a wine glass and seeing a distorted view of the room behind it. The glass deflects light rays emanating from background objects, producing the distorted image you see. As it turns out, gravity can also deflect light rays, and a very massive object like a galaxy can produce distorted images of luminous background sources, like a giant cosmic wine glass.  This effect is called strong gravitational lensing, and it is a useful tool in astrophysics since it allows us to study the mysterious dark matter that fills our universe through its gravitational lensing effects.<br /><>br />
              
              As an example, check out the image on the far left of the nearby galaxy Andromeda. The central image is what Andromeda would like like if it were strongly lensed by another galaxy.<br />
              
              On the far right, I've made an animation that shows what happens when a very dense, very massive blob of dark matter moves through the lensed arc. Although we can't directly detect this blob of dark matter, we can infer its presence by the distortion it produces in the lensed arc. <br />

          <h3>Image Magnifications in Quadrupoly Imaged Quasars</h3>

						<section>
							<p> When the background object is very bright but more compact than a galaxy, rather than observing a lensed arc you might see two or four duplicate images of it. The magnifications of these images are extremely sensitive to the presence of very small blobs of dark matter. <br /><br />
              
              To illustrate, in the animation below you'll see me drag a blob of dark matter (similar to the one I dragged across the arc of lensed-Andromeda) across one of the multiple images of a quadrupoly imaged backgroud object. In the left panel, you'll see how bright the image gets as the blob transits.
